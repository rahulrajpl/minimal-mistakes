This project is a fork from an awesome theme by [Agus Makmun](https://agusmakmun.github.io/) to host static but fully functional blog using jekyll and github pages. Details on how to reproduce/ fork this and add your own creativity is fully explained in the jekyll [blog](https://jekyllrb.com/) itself as well as in the source repo.

Feel free to take a look at it [here](#).
