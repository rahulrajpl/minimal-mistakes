In this project, experiments were carried out on KDD Cup 99 dataset and the challenge is to classify the network connections as 'good' or 'bad'. 

General details to the challenge is [here](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/task.html)

Dataset for this task is [here](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)

Entire project has worked on Google Colab with GPUs and a nerual net from tensorflow 2.0 library was modelled on full dataset. Accuracy obtianed in 99.75

Source code in google colab is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GrSVUY3rcwYCd-xp5juUjQ9Wbg_9Kq1i) and the other source code which were experimental can be accessed in this [link](https://github.com/rahulrajpl/malware-fine-grained-classification)
